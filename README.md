Software Development Lifecycle

Week 8 Journal:

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Computer Science and Software Development are more than just writing code and developing programs. More often than not, you are creating something for someone other than yourself. Meaning there is a critical communication channel that is now open. Communicating with a stakeholer requires strong commincations skills and the abilty to supress assumptions. When outlining requirements, putting youself in the shoes of the customer is a great way to understand the problem they are wanting to solve. Once you have a strong understanding of the "problem", user stories are a great way to extract the smaller details of each issue. User stories require specifics. No detail is too small when creating stories, and having clear and open communications with the stakeholder ensures the final deliverable is what was expected or envisioned by the customer. 

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

One approach I have taken when developing a program or starting a project is to understand what the final outcome looks like. Whether its building a shed or wrinting an script, understanding what I am working towards allows me to begin breaking the project down. This can be something as simple as a sketch on a dryerase board, just something to visualize my objective. Next I will begin to break the project down into "buckets". For the shed this would be my overall framework, in a program, this could be a rough UML diagram or outlining classes. From there I take each bucket and break it down further, until I worked all the way down to taking my first step. 
One Agile process I really like is the idea of sprints. At first, the idea of a fixed time for everything didnt seem productive. "What if something takes longer" was my initial drawback. However after understanding the overall process better, the idea of a sprint and specifically working through user stories, is a process I am likely to adopt going forward. 

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Defining a good team member is universal and not unique to software development. Strong communication, collaborative mindset, and understanding of your role are all factors that make a good team member. Being collaborative doesn't mean just working with others. Having the ability to ask for help is a trait that is often overlooked or undervalued, it requires a degree of humility. Also, understanding your role in the group is essential for cohession. There is a fine line between offering suggestions and experience, but you are not the product owner so at some point, you will need to fall in line. Steamrolling is not a quality trait in a good team member.
